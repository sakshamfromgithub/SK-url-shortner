    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> Feb 2026</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>SK URL Shortner</strong>. Your privacy is important to us.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website.
      By using this service, you agree to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      SK URL Shortner does not require users to create accounts or provide personal
      information. We only process the long URLs submitted by users for the purpose
      of generating shortened links.
    </p>

    <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>
      Submitted URLs are used only to create short links and enable redirection.
      We do not sell, trade, or share user data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Our website may use browser local storage to temporarily store shortened links
      for functionality purposes. We do not use tracking or advertising cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
    <p>
      Shortened links may redirect to external websites. We are not responsible for
      the privacy practices, content, or security of those websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      While we take reasonable measures to keep the service secure, no internet
      transmission method is completely secure. Users should avoid shortening
      sensitive or private URLs.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
      on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the
